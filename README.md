### Digital Twin Passport NFT
A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity, created using real-time data, machine learning, and computational models. They are widely used across industries such as manufacturing, smart cities, and energy to simulate conditions, predict outcomes, and identify potential issues before they escalate. The development of a digital twin goes hand-in-hand with the life cycle of the physical asset, involving various stakeholders during design, implementation, operation, and decommissioning stages. During these various phases, multiple stakeholders will interact with DT to update its services as well as use DT services.
