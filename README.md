## Digital Twin Passport NFT
A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical entity, constructed using real-time data, machine learning, and computational models. They're extensively employed in industries like manufacturing, smart cities, and energy for simulating conditions, predicting outcomes, and preempting potential issues. The creation of a digital twin aligns with the life cycle of the physical asset, engaging various stakeholders through the design, implementation, operation, and decommissioning phases. Throughout these stages, numerous stakeholders interact with the digital twin for service updates and utilization. Presently, the management of digital twins lacks defined ownership, governance, and transparency among stakeholders. Given their unique characteristics, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) could serve as a potential solution to these challenges.
